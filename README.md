# Modify a portfolio project

## About
This project requires me to demonstrate my skills as a developer by modifying an existing portfolio using a React library and React Bootstrap. I will also be using a Trello board to keep track of my tasks and progress, and Netlify to deploy the project. This project will simulate a real-world situation where a developer will start a project from an existing one.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to modify an existing portfolio to make it relevant to me and my developer skills.
