Iâ€™m a Navy Veteran trained as an IT Network Administrator with 5 years of experience. I decided to shift careers into software development because I wanted to go back to working with computers and software and then to build on the experience the Navy gave me. Ultimately, Iâ€™d like to combine these two careers of environmental and software development into a project, specifically in Environmental Justice. My management position in the environmental field has made me a highly accomplished, solutions-focused professional with exceptional management skills in project and human resources.",
