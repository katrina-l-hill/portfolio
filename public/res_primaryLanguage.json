      "description": "I'm Katrina Hill. I'm a Software Developer with a background in environmental compliance, enforcement, and management at the city and state level. I’m a Navy Veteran trained as an IT Network Administrator with 5 years of experience. I decided to shift careers into software development because I wanted to go back to working with computers and software and then to build on the experience the Navy gave me. Ultimately, I’d like to combine these two careers of environmental and software development into a project, specifically in Environmental Justice. My management position in the environmental field has made me a highly accomplished, solutions-focused professional with exceptional management skills in project and human resources.",
